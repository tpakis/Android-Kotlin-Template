# Android-Kotlin Template

This is a template repository I created, holding the most basic building foundations of any modern Android application. 100% kotlin including kotlin-dsl for gradle, Architecture components ViewModel for MVVM, Navigation Component, Dagger2 for dependency injection, ktlint for lint checks, Coroutines, LiveData and Timber for Logging. Also a bonus some extra helper classes in a core module.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. I avoided on purpose to include more stuff than the basic ones, because I wanted to avoid including boilerplate or unused code.
